# Journey of Linux and shell scripting

### **Day 1 14-10-2025**

### **Shell Scripting & Linux commands**
________________________________________
What I learned yesterday:
- Basics of Linux commands: 'mkdir', 'rmdir', 'touch', 'vi', 'ls', 'cd', 'chmod', 'cat', 'man', 
- Importance of shebang (#!/bin/bash) in shell scripts indicates a which interpreter to run that script.
- Created a simple automation shell script that: 
  1. Creates a folder 
  2. Creates files inside that folder 
- Understood why shell scripting is used: automation, integration, reusability, and saving time for 
  repetitive tasks. 

Experience: 
- Gained confidence using Linux commands and shell scripting for simple tasks.

### **Day 2 15-10-2025**
- Learned Ubuntu file system navigation (ls, cd, pwd) and handling folder names with spaces using quotes "".
- Created a shell script to backup 
  window file sys - /mnt/k/Clg_Notes/3 sem Notes  " to "
  Linux file sys - /home/keshava/project_backup1/docs.
- Used commands: mkdir -p, cp -r, echo, date
- Script prints a success message with timestamp; and verified files copied successfully

# Day 3 18-10-2025

- Practiced file and directory handling.
- Learned the difference between absolute path and relative paths
- Completed the KodeKloud task: Create a user with a non-interactive shell.

# Day 4 19-10-2025

Today I have done a small beginner level project 
# Description: A Script to list all resources available in the AWS using AWS CLI

- Firstly validated the command line arguments that user inputs
  Usage: $0 <region> <service_name>
- Check for AWS installed or not
- Check for AWS is configured or not
- To list resources from an AWS by implementing Switch case method
- Resources that are listed is 
  1. ec2
  2. s3 bucket
  3. dynamodb
  4. rds
  5. iam
  6. vpc
  7. eks
- Finally, to work efficient this script I have implemented cron jobs to execute on particular time
  while implementing this i was bit confused and not worked correctly.
- After sometime with the help of chatgpt and referring documentation I came to fix it and executed. 
- I have to practice this much more on this topic.
